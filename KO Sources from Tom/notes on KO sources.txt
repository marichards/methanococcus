-This is the paper for the HDR-formate reaction!
-Gives good reasoning for why to use MM for things
-vhuA+vhcA KO is lethal on H2, not on Formate
-fdhA and hdrB are not essential, because there's 2 functional copies of each

Disrupt Ehb
-Like above, contains reasoning for why to use MM
-Contains genes for CODH-ACS, POR, EhB, VOR, EhA, references others 
-ehbF gene (mmp1628) is non-essential for growth on McN (H2 supplied)

Formate Dependent H2 Production Whitman
-Looks like Mtd and Hmd are non-lethal for formate growth
-Appears that fdh1 is essential but fdh2 might not be (for formate growth)
-Some selenium things...when growing on formate with selenium, fruA is essential but fruC is not...
