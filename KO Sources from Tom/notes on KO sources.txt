Disruption of the Operon Encoding Ehb Hydrogenase Limits Anabolic CO2 Assimilation in the Archaeon Methanococcus maripaludis (Porat 2006)
-Like above, contains reasoning for why to use MM
-Contains genes for CODH-ACS, POR, EhB, VOR, EhA, references others 
-ehbF gene (mmp1628) is non-essential for growth on McN (H2 supplied)

Essential anaplerotic role for the energy-converting hydrogenase Eha in hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis (Lie 2012)
-MM901 is the WT strain
-Note that '#H2ase' just signifies how many hydrogenases were deleted
-3H2ase (fru,frc,hmd) mutant grows on formate and on H2 (though poorly on H2)
-5H2ase (fru,frc,hmd,vhu,vhc) requires formate AND H2 for growth; can't grow on H2 or formate alone
-6H2ase (fru,frc,hmd,vhu,vhc,ehbN) requires formate AND H2 for growth. 
-6H2ase makes methane from formate, not H2, but H2 helped when added (not sure on this)
-EhaHIJ are collectively essential on both formate and H2

Formate Dependent H2 Production by the Mesophilic Methanogen Methanococcus maripaludis (Lupa 2008)
-Looks like Mtd and Hmd are non-lethal for formate growth
-Appears that fdh1 is essential but fdh2 might not be (for formate growth)
-Some selenium things...when growing on formate with selenium, fruA is essential but fruC is not...


H2 Independent Growth of the Hydrogenotrophic Methanogen Methanococcus maripaludis (Costa 2013)


Protein complexing in a methanogen suggests electron bifurcation and electron delivery from formate to heterodisulfide reductase (Costa 2012)
-This is the paper for the HDR-formate reaction!
-Gives good reasoning for why to use MM for things
-vhuA+vhcA KO is lethal on H2, not on Formate
-fdhA and hdrB are not essential, because there's 2 functional copies of each

Roles of Coenzyme F420 Reducing Hydrogenases and Hydrogen and F420 Dependent Methylenetetrahydromethanopterin Dehydrogenases in Reduction of F420 and Production of Hydrogen during Methanogenesis (Hendrikson 2008)
-5 strains: -Hmd, -Mtd, -FrcA, -FruA, -FrcA-FruA
-Hmd + Mtd is an alternate pathway for reduction of F420 with H2
-Hmd and Mtd are non-essential (fruA or frcA can do the job)
-FrcA and FruA are non-essential (Hmd/Mtd can do the job); they are non-essential in the double KO as well
-FrcA,FruA,and Hmd together KO'ed ARE essential
-On formate, H2 production occurs, either by reversing F420-reducing hydrogenase or reversing the Hmd-Mtd cycle
-NOTE: all are on MM900, which has an Hpt deletion (from Alanine paper; what is it?)
