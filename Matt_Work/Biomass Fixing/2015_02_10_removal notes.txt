Essential:
MMP0178 (rxn03004_c0)-->also rxn03084_c0
MMP0179 (rxn03004_c0)-->also rxn03084_c0

Verdict: Remove rxn03004_c0 and change relationship to "AND" for rxn03084_c0 [See reference in lit sources]
**03004 is essential right now

MMP0439 AND MMP0919 (rxn01360_c0,rxn08335_c0,rxn08336_c0);
-->substitute rxn01361_c0 for all 3 of these (remove all 3)



Non-Essential:
MMP0356-->'rxn08713_c0' [I think I can remove this]
MMP0497-->'rxn03397_c0','rxn10094_c0' [I think I can remove these]
