Put in new reactions, but taking out folates is a problem; here's the reactions that are apparently essential and contain folates:

>> both = intersect(ess_rxns,rxns)

both = 

    'biomass0'
    'rxn00686_c0'
    'rxn00692_c0'
    'rxn00912_c0'
    'rxn03004_c0'
    'rxn03137_c0'
    'rxn04954_c0'
    'rxn12649_c0'
Using diagnoseMissingMet, here's what each makes or uses (I think):
>> mets = diagnoseMissingMet(model,'rxn00686_c0')
mets = 
    'Dihydrofolate_c0'
>> mets = diagnoseMissingMet(model,'rxn00692_c0')
mets = 
    '5-10-Methylenetetrahydrofolate_c0'
    'Tetrahydrofolate_c0'	
>> mets = diagnoseMissingMet(model,'rxn00912_c0')
mets = 
    '2-Dehydropantoate_c0'	
>> mets = diagnoseMissingMet(model,'rxn03004_c0')
mets = 
    '10-Formyltetrahydrofolate_c0'
    'Tetrahydrofolate_c0'	
>> mets = diagnoseMissingMet(model,'rxn03137_c0')
mets = 
    'AICAR_c0'
    'FAICAR_c0'
>> mets = diagnoseMissingMet(model,'rxn04954_c0')
mets = 
    '5-Methyltetrahydrofolate_c0'
>> mets = diagnoseMissingMet(model,'rxn12649_c0')
mets = 
    'Tetrahydrofolate_c0'
	
What do AICAR and FAICAR do that's important? What about 2-Dehydropantoate and Dihydrofolate? 

Here's the reactions they're in:
rxn00832_c0	H2O_c0 + IMP_c0 	<=>	FAICAR_c0 	(mmp1373 or mmp1310)
rxn01520_c0	dUMP_c0 + 5-10-Methylenetetrahydrofolate_c0 	->	dTMP_c0 + Dihydrofolate_c0 	(mmp1379 or mmp0986)
rxn01790_c0	NADP_c0 + Pantoate_c0 	<=>	H_c0 + NADPH_c0 + 2-Dehydropantoate_c0 	(mmp0672 or mmp0654)
rxn03135_c0	L-Glutamine_c0 + phosphoribulosylformimino-AICAR-phosphate_c0 	->	H_c0 + L-Glutamate_c0 + AICAR_c0 + D-erythro-imidazol-glycerol-phosphate_c0 	((mmp0256 or mmp1082) and (mmp1722 or mmp1083))
rxn03136_c0	SAICAR_c0 	<=>	Fumarate_c0 + AICAR_c0 	mmp0971

All of these are essential, but why? In order:
mets = 
    'FAICAR_c0'
    'IMP_c0'
mets = 
    'dTMP_c0'	
mets = 
    'Pantoate_c0'	
mets = 
    'D-erythro-imidazol-glycerol-phosphate_c0'	
mets = 
    'AICAR_c0'
	
What does IMP do? Apparently nothing that's essential by itself, and it has lots of reactions	

-----------
One problem seems to be AICAR. It must be made to make Histidine:

L-Glutamine + phosphoribulosylformimino-AICAR-phosphate -> H+ + L-Glutamate + AICAR + D-erythro-imidazol-glycerol-phosphate

The only way it can be used now is to make SAICAR

rxn03136_c0	SAICAR_c0 	<=>	Fumarate_c0 + AICAR_c0 	mmp0971

But there's nowhere for the SAICAR to go, it's only made:

rxn03147_c0	5'-Phosphoribosyl-4-carboxy-5-aminoimidazole_c0 + ATP_c0 + L-Aspartate_c0 	->	2.000000 H_c0 + Phosphate_c0 + ADP_c0 + SAICAR_c0 	mmp0540

Normally, the AICAR is used elsewhere:

rxn03137_c0	AICAR_c0 + 10-Formyltetrahydrofolate_c0 	->	FAICAR_c0 + Tetrahydrofolate_c0

But now we don't need it. Bah! So it seems an AICAR (or SAICAR) sink is in order
-->Only 2 reactions exist for SAICAR and we already have them
-->AICAR is in 8 reactions. We already have 2 and have removed 1. Note that the 2 we have left have HIGH confidence scores but the one we removed is a "GapFill". The remaining 5:

rxn03039	PPi + AICAR <= PRPP + 5-Amino-4-imidazolecarboxyamide
rxn04784	ATP + Formate + AICAR => ADP + Phosphate + FAICAR
rxn06761	H2O + phosphoribulosylformimino-AICAR-phosphate <=> AICAR + 5'-Phospho-D-1-ribulosylformimine
rxn12778	PPi + AICAR <=> PRPP + C04051
rxn12993	L-Glutamine + 5-[(5-phospho-1-deoxy-D-ribulos-1-ylamino)methylideneamino]-1-(5-phospho-D-ribosyl)imidazole-4-carboxamide <=> L-Glutamate + H+ + D-erythro-imidazol-glycerol-phosphate + AICAR

**None of these seem to be there; could also turn the other SAICAR reaction reversible, which I think it should be
