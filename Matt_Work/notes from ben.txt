OMIX Tasks:
-Get academic license (wait for approval)
X-Make map of methanogenesis
-Make file to create current model
-Make maps of amino acids
-Make any other important maps (nitrogen fixation? glycolysis?)
-Genome-scale maps?


Other tasks on M.maripaludis:
-Setup version control
-Fix up that there media formulation
-Setup a meeting with John Leigh
-Read up on AOM stuff and Methanococcus

Website tasks:
-Fix the home page text
-Link the other compound IDs (PubChem, ChEBI)
-Change all external links to new pages
-Add SEED IDs for a bunch of early things

---------
Tools for manipulating:
-Get the formula so I'm not grasping at weirdness for in/out fluxes:
>> printFluxVector(M_mar,sol.x,'True','True',-1,[],[],'True')

**So here, I get some interesting things:
Ex_cpd11640_c0	 -> H2_c0 	-1000	
EX_cpd00011_e0	CO2_e0  <=> 	-214.908	
EX_cpd00001_e0	H2O_e0  <=> 	402.796	
Ex_cpd01024_c0	EX_Methane_c0  -> 	193.673
EX_cpd00067_e0	H_e0  <=> 	25.4226	
EX_cpd11416_c0	Biomass_c0  -> 	1.88014

There's also a fair amount of Uracil coming out and a bunch of octadecanoate coming in....I don't know why
-->It's a bit different with the "new_model", but not much.  A bit more biomass, methane, and H2O, less H, more CO2....there's also a second CO2_e0 reaction...I don't know why
-->The second reaction is the cobalt ions.  AHA!

**Updated methanogenesis picture: arranged, added H2 and CO2 uptake pathways. 
-->There's no acetate uptake right now
-->There IS formate uptake
**I should be able to make it grow WITH formate but not H2, plus (I think) with acetate

NOTES FROM MEETING WITH BEN
1. Find a "yardstick" to measure the model against...
-Best would be having gene essentiality, product formation info, and metabolomics on multiple defined media
-->Train the model on one medium, test it on another one!
-None of this data?  Maybe we can get some from them?
-The metabolomics on inner metabolites is secondary to getting info on products
-Fallback: use % of genome covered, % of metabolites accounted for, and things like that to validate

2. Get in touch with my contact person...maybe it's Kyle Costa?  
-Ask Nathan to setup a meeting and get me a point person on this project
-Ask John Leigh who the contact person is

3. A reconstruction and model are 2 different things.  If there's no good reason to pull something out, don't pull it out of the reconstruction because:
-It could be a target for metabolomics, so we can see if it's really there or not.  If it's not there, THEN think about pulling it out
-If it's a dead end and we find a different annotation for it that can carry flux, THEN maybe we can change it. 

4. It's qualitative, not quantitative that matters.  So I probably shouldn't bother tuning ATPM or anything like that just to get the numbers to match.  Instead, look at what should/shouldn't be produced and what is/isn't produced.  Do they match?

5. On biomass, best to keep it hierarchical so that it's more flexible, plus it's easier to make changes.  The biomassPrecursorCheck function won't work the same, but I could change that

6. Making my own functions to deal with things is a good idea:
-Make functions to change between media conditions (could also change biomass functions for different media)
-Function to make the newest model from the original model
-Make whatever other tools I need

7. There's no protocol for model-driven bioengineering.  The backup is to improve models and hope somebody makes a method. 
-The current best approaches are driven by expert knowledge; this gives more motivation for improving accuracy of models

8. Including chemistry or engineering experts is important to do "back of the envelope" calculations, like whether something is thermodynamically feasible

9. Dead ends and double dead ends are useful as possible metabolomic targets

10. Other than yardstick, next task is to make sure everything is charge/mass-balanced and ensure we can get from inputs to outputs. 

11. Setting up a GIT repository is a very good idea
