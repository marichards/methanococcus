Following info is in the Thiele and Palsson paper from 2010:

Evidence Type: Biochemical Data
Confidence Score: 4
Examples: Direct evidence for gene product function and biochemical reaction: Protein purification, biochemical assays, experimentally solved protein structures, and comparative gene-expression studies

Evidence Type: Genetic Data
Confidence Score: 3
Examples: Direct and indirect evidence for gene function: Knock-out characterization, knock-in characterization, and over-expression

Evidence Type: Physiological data
Confidence Score: 2
Examples: Indirect evidence for biochemical reactions based on physiological data: secretion products or defined medium components serve as evidence for transport and metabolic reactions

Evidence Type: Sequence data
Confidence Score: 2
Examples: Evidence for gene function: Genome annotation, SEED annotation

Evidence Type: Modeling data
Confidence Score: 1
Examples: No evidence is available but reaction is required for modeling. The included function is a hypothesis and needs experimental verification. The reaction mechanism may be different from the included reaction(s). 

Evidence Type: Not evaluated
Confidence Score: 0
