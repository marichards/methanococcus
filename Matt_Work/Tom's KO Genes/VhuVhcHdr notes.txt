Notes on HDR genes:

H2 Form:
mmp0825 and mmp1697 both look like HdrA
mmp0821 is vhcD
mmp0822 is vhcG
mmp0823 is vhcA
mmp0824 is vhcB

mmp1692 is vhuB
mmp1693 is vhuU
mmp1694 is vhuA
mmp1695 is vhuG
mmp1696 is vhuD

Formate form:
mmp0825 and mmp1697 both look like HdrA
mmp1053 is hdrB2
mmp1054 is hdrC2
mmp1154 is hdrC1
mmp1155 is hdrB1
mmp0138 is fdhA
mmp0139 is fdhB
mmp1297 is fdhB also
mmp1298 is fdhA also

Current rules:
FOR H2
((mmp0825 and mmp0821 and mmp0822 and mmp0823 and mmp0824) or (mmp1697 and mmp1692 and mmp1693 and mmp1694 and mmp1695 and mmp1696)) and ((mmp1053 and mmp1054) or (mmp1155 and mmp1154))

All of vhc and one form of hdrA OR all of vhu and the other form of hdrA, PLUS one of the hdrBC forms

FOR FORMATE
((mmp0825 or mmp1697) and ((mmp1053 and mmp1054) or (mmp1155 and mmp1154))) and ((mmp0138 and mmp0139) or (mmp1297 and mmp1298))

Either form of hdrA plus either form of hdrBC, plus one of the two fdhABs

***Resulting Idea: knockout vhuD, vhcD, and then both. See if they cause death...
-->These 2 are prospectively the electron shuttlers. 

Question: What happens if you grow in absence of selenocysteine? Which one is prevalent in expression?
