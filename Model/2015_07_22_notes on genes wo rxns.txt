Going through Artemis:

mmp1144: bacA, the gene for bacitracin resistance

mmp1151: cobalamin-dependent methionine synthase....I just took this out to remove folates

mmp1233: Receptor protein for Fdh or something

mmp1553: rdxA; catalyzes reduction of flavin, nitrocompound, quinones, and azo compounds using NAD(P)H

mmp1631: don't know what it does; "PAP2-like protein" 

mmp0264: MscMJ; mechanosensitive ion channel

mmp0305 and mmp306: I think these should be added back to rxn05939_c0, where they used to be

mmp0356: might be involved as glycosyltransferase with acetamido sugar synthesis, but we don't know

mmp0388: geranylgeranyl-bacteriochlorophyll reductase gene, bchP; I don't know what I'd have this do, so I'm taking it out

mmp0439: converts between orotate and dihydroorotate; i reannotated this because the electron carriers it used were wrong
    
mmp0496: blast from artemis shows it's a glutamate synthase binding domain; remove for now

mmp0529: annotated as sulfate transporter; should probably be tungstate or molybdate

mmp0534: another mechanosensitive ion channel

mmp0663: annotated as sulfate transporter; should probably be tungstate or molybdate

-->Go back to transporters and add things (note: tungstate and molybdate aren't in model but probably should be in biomass)
** For the moment, leave these two genes alone and maybe add those later
	
mmp0737: unknown function, seems to point to aspartate dehydrogenase, but don't really know

mmp0768: unknown function; take this out

mmp0829: cobalamin-dependent methionine synthase....I just took this out to remove folates

mmp0919: subunit of dihydroorotate....I'll put this with 0439, as it was before

mmp1274: acyl-coa synthetases/amp-fa-ligases; was on Acetate + ATP -> Acetyl-CoA + AMP but John removed it...why?
    
mmp0937: error I made; i've corrected it now

-Two I think are an alternative methionine synthesis pathway
-Two I think are associated with Succinyl-CoA -> Oxoglutarate
-Two I think are WO4/MoO4 transport genes
-One I think is associated with Acetate -> Acetyl-CoA

EMAIL THEM! (Or talk on Monday)
