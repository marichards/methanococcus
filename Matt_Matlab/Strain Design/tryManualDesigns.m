function tryManualDesigns

% Test out the manual strain designs from Dr. John Leigh

% Design#1: Add in a reduction pathway that uses H2 directly; need to clone
% in a hydrogenase too

% Design#2: Add in H2 -> Fd reaction plus a reduction pathway (e.g. nitrate)
% then require that free energy be negative

% Design#3: Use Fumarate --> Succinate conversion to reform disulfide; has
% no way to account for fd though! [Rxn is 'Tfr' and goes correct way
% already]
