## iMR539, a Genome-Scale Metabolic Model of *Methanococcus maripaludis*

This repository contains the genome scale metabolic model of *Methanococcus maripaludis* and a collection of scripts for helping to simulate growth, perturb the model, and query various aspects of the model. The major directories are as follows:

### Model

Contains the most recent iteration of the *M. maripaludis* model, marked with the date it was created. It also contains the exact iMR539 model from publication in SBML and Matlab formats, the original automated model created using tools in Kbase, and a directory containing all versions of the model that came in between. 

### Matlab Scripts

Contains nearly all scripts created for manipulating and simulating growth with the *M. maripaludis* model. This directory is further divided into the following categories of scripts:
