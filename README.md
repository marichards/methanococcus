## iMR539, a Genome-Scale Metabolic Model of *Methanococcus maripaludis*

This repository contains the genome scale metabolic model of *Methanococcus maripaludis* and a collection of scripts for helping to simulate growth, perturb the model, and query various aspects of the model. The major directories are as follows:

### Model

This is the primary directory and contains the most recent iteration of the living <i>M. maripaludis</i> model. It also contains the original automated model created using tools in Kbase and a directory containing all versions of the model the came in between. 

### Matt_Matlab

Contains nearly all scripts created for manipulating and simulating growth with the <i>M. maripaludis</i> model. This directory is further divided into the following categories of scripts:

#### Data Compilation for Paper

Contains scripts used to create tables and figures for the MM model manuscript.

#### MM Growth Sims

Contains scripts used to simulate growth of the *M. maripaludis* model under a variety of different carbon and nitrogen sources.

#### Model Changing
