Notes on adenylate kinase: it's adkA in MM and we have a gene, but I can't find a good paper. 

-Whitman paper has a new thing called adkB too

-Old paper with info about kinases:

The adenylate kinase genes of M. voltae, M. thermolithotrophicus,
M. jannaschii, and M. igneus define a new family of adenylate kinases
