To accomplish today:

-Get demos from Tom on:
1) Dealing with Isoenzymes
2) Looking at genes from the other model

-Ask Tom about:
1) 4 reactions we added that I don't think we need

-Write blurb for Shuyi's paper


****TALKING WITH JOHN
-Screw metabolomics (I think...)
-Send him isoenzymes
-Screw the other model for not
-Continue fleshing out literature
-Pull out some novel pathways we predict that aren't in the artemis, then look for transporter possibilities, then maybe we can KO them and test for auxotrophy

NOTES ON CoM Synthesis
ComA: Phosphoenolpyruvate(PEP) + HSO3 -> R-Phosphosulfolacetate
ComB (phosphosulfolactate phosphatase): R-Phosphosulfolactate -> Pi + R-Sulfolactate
ComC: R-Sulfolactate + NAD <=> Sulfopyruvate + NADH + H+
ComDE (sulfopyruvate decarboxylase): Sulfopyruvate + H+ --> Sulfoacetaldehyde + CO2
Last step: Sulfoacetaldehyde -> CoM (don't know how)

ComA: rxn07307_c0, mmp0273
ComB: rxn04036_c0, mmp0161
ComC: rxn04934_c0, mmp1133
ComDE: rxn04026_c0, mmp0411 or mmp1689
Others: 3 reactions, rxn10603_c0, rxn10598_c0, rxn10479_c0, no genes

Action items:
1) Check pyruvate decarboxylases and see if they're multi-subunit
-->It appears to be multi subunits; it says so in the 2002 paper!
2) Look at other 4 papers
3) Look at the E.coli papers

*****Change comDE to an AND!
*****Change CODH to CODH_ACS
