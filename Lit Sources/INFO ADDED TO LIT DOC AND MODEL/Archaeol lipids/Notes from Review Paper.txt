From Review paper, here's the basics:

First we synthesize Isopentenenyl diphosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP) are the building blocks of isoprenoids (membrane lipids in this case)
1) Acetyl-CoA -> Acetoacetyl-CoA
2) Acetoacetyl-CoA -> Hydroxymethyl-glutaryl-CoA 
3) Hydroxymethyl-glutaryl-CoA -> Mevalonate
4) Mevalonate -> Mevalonate-5-phosphate
5) Mevalonate-5-phosphate -> Isopenteneyl phosphate
6) Isopenteneyl phosphate -> Isopentenenyl diphosphate
7) Isopentenenyl diphosphate <=> Dimethylallyl diphosphate

Next, those molecules combine to make geranylgeranyl diphosphate(GGPP)
8) Isopentenenyl diphosphate  + Dimethylallyl diphosphate -> geranylgeranyl diphosphate

Then it incorporates a G1P (sn-glycerol-1-phosphate), which is synthesized from dihydroxyacetone phosphate. The result is GGGP, which is long
9) Dihydroxyacetone phosphate + NADH -> Glycerol-1-phosphate + NAD+
10) Glycerol-1-phosphate + geranylgeranyl diphosphate -> 3-O-geranylgeranyl-sn-glyceryl-1-phosphate

Now the GGGP and GGPP combine to make DGGGP
11) geranylgeranyl diphosphate + 3-O-geranylgeranyl-sn-glyceryl-1-phosphate -> 2,3-bis-O-geranylgeranyl-sn-glyceryl-1-phosphate

The DGGGP incorporates a CDP head to make CDP-archaeol
12) 2,3-bis-O-geranylgeranyl-sn-glyceryl-1-phosphate + CTP -> CDP-archaeol + PPi

The archaeol can now incorporate different polar head groups. In one case, you can put on a serine head:
13) CDP-archaeol + L-Serine -> Archaetidylserine + CMP

It can also incorporate inositol as a head group; AI is archaetidylinositol:
14) L-myo-inositol-1-phosphate + CDP-archaeol -> AI-phosphate + CMP
15) AI-phosphate -> AI + PPi

Membrane lipids get saturated; it looks like there's evidence that it happens after adding the head group, so:
16) Archaetidylserine + NADH -> Saturated Archaetidylserine + NAD+

Then, the saturated lipids are somehow made into tetraethers (caldarchaeol). But the archaeols themselves should be in the biomass too
17) Saturated Archaetidylserine -????-> Caldarchaeol

1) Non-specific; leave what's already in the model
2) rxn01454_c0, already in model; MMP1211 (in tree, from BLAST with MMC-something)

4) rxn01607_c0, already in model; MMP1335 (in tree, from BLAST with MMC7) 
5) rxn13772 5-phosphomevalonate <=> CO2 + Isopentenyl phosphate [unsure of gene, missing from model]
**Remove rxn02322_c0 and rxn00829_c0, they're wrong

6) *No reaction ID* Isopentenyl phosphate + Phosphate <=> Isopentenyldiphosphate; MMP1645 (from BLAST)

Matsumi et al (2011) --> Barkley et al (2004) 
7) rxn00830_c0 Isopentenyldiphosphate <=> DMAPP; MMP0043

Fujiwara et al (2004)
8) rxn01213_c0 Isopentenyldiphosphate + DMAPP => PPi + Geranyldiphosphate; ACTUALLY I DON'T THINK THIS IS CORRECT
GPP: C10H18O7P2
GGPP: C20H34O7P2
According to paper, it's rxn01213_c0, THEN:
GPP + IPP -> FPP: rxn01466_c0 Isopentenyldiphosphate + Geranyldiphosphate => PPi + Farnesyldiphosphate
FPP + IPP -> GGPP: rxn01486_c0 Isopentenyldiphosphate + Farnesyldiphosphate => PPi + Geranylgeranyl diphosphate
