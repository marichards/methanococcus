mfnA (from blastP w/Janaschii): mmp0131
mfnB: (from blastP w/Jannaschii): mmp0708
mfnC: no blastP hits w/Jannaschii
mfnD: don't know gene yet

Devised scheme for F1-P synthesis:
1) Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate + dihydroxyacetone-P -> 4-(hydroxymethyl)-2-furancarboxaldehyde + 2 H2O + Pi [MfnB]
2) 4-(hydroxymethyl)-2-furancarboxaldehyde + Alanine -> 5-(aminomethyl)-3-furanmethanol-P + Pyruvate [MfnC]

Devised scheme for gamma-glutamyl-tyramine synthesis:
3) Tyrosine -> Tyramine + CO2 [MfnA]
4) Tyramine + Glutamate ATP -> gamma-glutamyl-tyramine + ADP + Pi [MfnD]


Rest are proposed in 2014 paper (White lab):
5) 5-(aminomethyl)-3-furanmethanol-P + ATP -> 5-(aminomethyl)-3-furanmethanol-PP + ADP [F1-P->F1-PP]
6) 5-(aminomethyl)-3-furanmethanol-PP + gamma-glutamyl-tyramine -> APMF-glu
7) APMF-glu + 6-11 Glutamate -> Methanofuran-d

**APMF-glu is 4{[4-(2-aminoethyl)phenoxy]methyl}-2-furanmethanamine

REACTIONS in KBASE:
3) is rxn00529_c0
4) is not there

OTHER COMPOUNDS in KBASE:
DHAP is cpd00095 (Glycerone-phosphate_c0)

Yeah, that's about it
