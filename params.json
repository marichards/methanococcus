The major directories are as follows:\r\n\r\n### Model\r\n\r\nThis is the primary directory and contains the most recent iteration of the living <i>M. maripaludis</i> model. It also contains the original automated model created using tools in Kbase and a directory containing all versions of the model the came in between. \r\n\r\n### Matt_Matlab\r\n\r\nContains nearly all scripts created for manipulating and simulating growth with the <i>M. maripaludis</i> model. This directory is further divided into various self-explanatory categories of different scripts.\r\n",
